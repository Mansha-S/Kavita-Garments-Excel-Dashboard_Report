## Problem Statement 
Kavita Garments is a clothing store ,sells it's product on different online channels like Meesho , Ajio ,Myntra ,Flipkart etc.
,They have a data of year 2022 they are asking for an Annual report in the form of Excel Dashboard , also they are asking for Insights that can be 
generated through report so that they can understand their customers and grow more sales in upcomming years.

## Approach towards solution
I started asking some general questions about the sales like 

1. What is  Sales Vs Orders relations 
2. Which month got the highest sales and orders
3. Who purchased more Men or Women
4. List top 5 sates contributing to the sales
5. Which channel is contributing maximum sales
6. which is the highest salling category
7. Different Order status

## Data Cleaning 

- Handling Null Vallues,saw if there is any null value in any cell
- Handling incorrect formate in columns , modified Gender column ,Qty column

## Data Processing

- Added Age group Column  based on Age column , age > 50 as Senior, 50 > age > 30 Adult and age< 30 as Teenager
- Added Month column by Extracting month from Date

## Data Visualisation
For data visualization I made following graphs 

#### Sales Vs Orders 

#### Sales : Men Vs Women

#### Order Status 

#### Sales : Top 5 states

#### Orders : Age Vs Gender

#### Orders Vs Channel

I have added three slicers for these graphs on the basis of month , channel , and category so all the visualization can be seen on peticular monnth , channel and categories or for multiple months , channels and categories 
in combinations.
